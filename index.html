            Rose is the representative for Tennessee’s 6th congressional

            2023.

            Rose is among the Republican legislators who participated in the
            months-long, multifarious attempted coup following the 2020
            presidential election. Shortly after the election, Rose joined a
            case before the Supreme Court calling for all the votes for
            president in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — states
            that were narrowly won by Democrats — to be discarded, in order to
            change the outcome of the election, based on lies and a preposterous
            legal argument which the Supreme Court rejected. (Following the
            rejection of several related cases before the Supreme Court, another
            legislator who joined the case called for violence.) On January 6,
            2021 in the hours after the insurrection at the Capitol, Rose voted
            to reject the state-certified election results of Arizona and/or
            Pennsylvania (states narrowly won by Democrats), which could have
            changed the outcome of the election. These legislators have
            generally changed their story after their vote, claiming it was
            merely a protest and not intended to change the outcome of the
            election as they clearly sought prior to the vote. The January 6,
            2021 insurrection at the Capitol disrupted Congress’s count of
            electors that determined the outcome of the presidential election
            with the goal to prevent President Joe Biden from taking office.
